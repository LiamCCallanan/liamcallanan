					<div class="description" id="desc1">I am a 17 year old Barrington High school senior who has an interest in both computer science and art. I enjoy both the creativity of design and the organization of computing, which is why I have both a graphic design portfolio and some fun programs (that I made) that you can download. Going into college, I want to major in computer science.</div>

				<div class="windowTitle" id="c2">Why did I make this site?</div>
				<div class="description_large" id="lDesc1"> This website is essentially a personal portfolio, displaying my work in photography, graphic design, music, and programming. It serves as an interactive portfolio, giving you the chance to see what I enjoy creating.</div>
				<div class="description_large" id="lDesc2"> This site is also my high school senior project. With the help of my mentor, Brown University student Ben LeVeque, I learned about how to make a website from scratch. I was introduced to HTML, JavaScript, and JQuery, all of which helping me to build this site. I also see this site as a gateway to larger projects and better work experiences in the future.</div>
