				<div class="description_large" id="lDesc1">Mine(Craft) Sweeper is a program that I coded based on the games MineCraft and Minsweeper. I made it with the help of my Senior Project mentor, Ben LeVeque, who gave me this project so that I could learn the basics of Javascript and HTML. Doing this gave me some basic knowledge to work with, allowing me to understand enough to make this website.</div>

The class focuses on teaching students the basics of object oriented programming in Java using a project-based teaching style. These programs were some of the ones that I was given to do, including Pac Man, Tetris, and Doodle Jump (from left to right). Click the images to download them (non-mobile users only).</div>
